The first hint to the location is the number on the taxi, which indicates that the photo was taken in Seattle.

After a few google searches, we can find a wikileaks pdf that lists some datacenters and their locations, there aren't that many in seattle, so we can go through them one by one.

We finally find this one, looks familiar ?
